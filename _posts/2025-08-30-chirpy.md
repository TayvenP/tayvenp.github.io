I recently set up my personal site using the Chirpy Jekyll theme. Here's how I did it:

1. **Set up GitHub**  
   I made sure I had a GitHub account ready to host my site.

2. **Visit the Chirpy Getting Started Guide**  
   I followed the instructions on the official guide: [Getting Started with Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

3. **Go to the Chirpy Starter Repository**  
   [Chirpy Starter on GitHub](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)

4. **Use the Template**  
   I clicked **"Use this template"** and selected **"Create a new repository"**.

5. **Name the Repository**  
   I named it `username.github.io` (replacing `username` with my GitHub username) so GitHub Pages would recognize it correctly.

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   In **Settings → Pages**, I ensured Pages was set to **main branch**.

7. **Configure `_config.yml`**  
   I edited the `_config.yml` file to add my site details.  
   Initially, I ran into errors because I accidentally left a `-` when deleting the Twitter link. Once I fixed that and committed the changes, everything worked!

Now my site is live and running the Chirpy theme smoothly.

## 🔧 Configuring `_config.yml` (Required Settings)

Once Chirpy is installed, `_config.yml` is where you set your blog’s identity and core settings.  
Here are the **minimum recommended changes**:

```yaml
title: "Your Blog Title"
tagline: "A short description or tagline"
url: "https://yourusername.github.io"
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  avatar: "/assets/img/avatar.png" # optional
lang: "en"
timezone: "Australia/Sydney
```

## Writing the Post Header (Front Matter)

Every Jekyll post starts with a **YAML front matter block** at the very top of the file.  
This tells Jekyll (and Chirpy) how to render and categorise your post.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: 2025-08-30 20:00:00 +1000
categories: [setup, jekyll, chirpy]
tags: [jekyll, github, chirpy, tutorial]
---
```

## Saving Your Post

Finally, save your completed Markdown file into the `_posts` directory of your project.

The filename **must** follow Jekyll’s required format:


For example:

2025-08-30-chirpy.md

**Tips:**
- Use lowercase letters.
- Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`).
- Avoid special characters.
- Match the date in the filename to the `date` in your post’s front matter.
