I recently set up my personal site using the Chirpy Jekyll theme. Here's how I did it:

1. **Set up GitHub**  
   I made sure I had a GitHub account ready to host my site.

2. **Visit the Chirpy Getting Started Guide**  
   I followed the instructions on the official guide: [Getting Started with Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

3. **Go to the Chirpy Starter Repository**  
   [Chirpy Starter on GitHub](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)

4. **Use the Template**  
   I clicked **"Use this template"** and selected **"Create a new repository"**.

5. **Name the Repository**  
   I named it `username.github.io` (replacing `username` with my GitHub username) so GitHub Pages would recognize it correctly.

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   In **Settings > Pages**, I ensured Pages was set to **main branch**.

7. **Configure `_config.yml`**  
   I edited the `_config.yml` file to add my site details.  
   Initially, I ran into errors because I accidentally left a `-` when deleting the Twitter link. Once I fixed that and committed the changes, everything worked!

Now my site is live and running the Chirpy theme smoothly.

## Configuring _config.yml (Required Settings)

Once Chirpy is installed, `_config.yml` is where I set my blog’s identity and core settings.  
Here are the **minimum recommended changes**:

```yaml
title: "Your Blog Title"
tagline: "A short description or tagline"
url: "https://yourusername.github.io"
author:
  name: "Your Name"
  avatar: "/assets/img/avatar.png" # optional
lang: "en"
timezone: "Australia/Sydney
```

## Writing the Post Header (Front Matter)

To post my first post I had to write a file header. Every Jekyll post starts with a **YAML front matter block** at the very top of the file.  
This tells Jekyll (and Chirpy) how to render and categorise your post.

Example:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: 2025-08-30 20:00:00 +1000
categories: [setup, jekyll, chirpy]
tags: [jekyll, github, chirpy, tutorial]
---
```

## Saving Your Post

Finally, to save my fist post I created a Markdown file into the `_posts` directory of my project.

The filename **must** follow Jekyll’s required format:


For example:

2025-08-30-chirpy.md

**Tips:**
- Use lowercase letters.
- Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`).
- Avoid special characters.
- Match the date in the filename to the `date` in your post’s front matter.

## How to Upload Your avatar.png File to a New Directory on GitHub

Finally I had to create a new folder and upload my avatar icon `avatar.png` file.  
Here’s how I uploaded my `avatar.png` file **directly in GitHub’s web interface**.

---

### 1. Open the Repository
- Go to the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).

### 2. Start Creating a File
- Click **Add file > Create new file**.

### 3. Name the Folder and File
- In the **file name** field, I typed the folder name, then a forward slash `/img/avatar/`, then `README.md`.

### 2. Navigate to the Target Directory
- Then I went to the new directory `assets/images/avatar`. 

### 3. Start the Upload
- Click **Add file > Upload files**.

### 4. Select Your `avatar.png`
- I uploaded my `avatar.png` file into the `~/avatar/ directory.

### 5. Commit the File
- I scrolled down to the **Commit changes** section.
- Added a commit message: uploaded avatar image
- Finally I deleted the `README.md` file I created to create the directory.
