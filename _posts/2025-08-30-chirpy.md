I recently set up my personal site using the Chirpy Jekyll theme. Here's how I did it:

1. **Set up GitHub**  
   I made sure I had a GitHub account ready to host my site.

2. **Visit the Chirpy Getting Started Guide**  
   I followed the instructions on the official guide: [Getting Started with Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

3. **Go to the Chirpy Starter Repository**  
   [Chirpy Starter on GitHub](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)

4. **Use the Template**  
   I clicked **"Use this template"** and selected **"Create a new repository"**.

5. **Name the Repository**  
   I named it `username.github.io` (replacing `username` with my GitHub username) so GitHub Pages would recognize it correctly.

6. **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   In **Settings â†’ Pages**, I ensured Pages was set to **main branch**.

7. **Configure `_config.yml`**  
   I edited the `_config.yml` file to add my site details.  
   Initially, I ran into errors because I accidentally left a `-` when deleting the Twitter link. Once I fixed that and committed the changes, everything worked!

Now my site is live and running the Chirpy theme smoothly.
