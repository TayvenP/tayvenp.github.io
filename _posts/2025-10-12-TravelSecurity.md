## Top 10 Cybersecurity Tips for Travelers

### 1. Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi
Hotel and airport Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured. I used a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** service like Proton VPN to encrypt my internet traffic, protecting my data from hackers and snoops.

### 2. Secure Your iPhone with a Wrist Lanyard  
To prevent theft or accidental loss, I attached a **lanyard to my iPhone** and wore it around my wrist. I also made sure **not to walk around with my phone out**, especially in unfamiliar areas, keeping it hidden helped me avoid looking like a distracted tourist.  
I stored my passwords and sensitive info in **my favourite password manager**, so I didn't need to type or remember them while traveling.  
I got these **cool travel lanyards from Amazon**, and they work with almost any device as long as you have a case. The **anchor tab** goes inside the case and pops out under the USB-C charging port on your phone, allowing you to attach any lanyard you want. No need for a special case, these anchor tabs are easy to find on Amazon and usually come with a lanyard included.

### 3. Before You Travel: Set Up and Securely Store Recovery Phrases
I prepared for the worst by **setting up and securely storing my account recovery phrases** before I left. This meant that if I lost my phone, I could still access my accounts once I got home.

### 4. I Never Have Auto-Join Hotspot Enabled
To avoid accidentally connecting to insecure networks, I always keep **auto-join hotspot disabled** on my devices.

### 5. Set Up a Travel eSIM or Global Roaming
Before traveling, I activated a **travel eSIM or global roaming plan**. This allowed me to use mobile data securely and avoid relying on public Wi-Fi networks altogether.

### 6. Changed AirDrop to Contacts Only
Instead of turning off AirDrop completely, I changed my **AirDrop settings to "Contacts Only"** to reduce the risk of receiving unwanted files from strangers.

### 7. I Only Used a Power Bank in Public
When I needed to charge my phone in public, I **only used my own power bank**. This helped me avoid the risks associated with public USB charging stations.

### 8. Use an Over-the-Shoulder Sling Travel Bag
I carried a "European Carryall" or a **compact over-the-shoulder sling travel bag for men**,  which you can easily find on Amazon. It was excellent for keeping my **family's passports, wallet, phone, keys, and essential travel documents** all in one place. The bag was small enough to fit under my arm on the London Tube (avoiding pickpockets) and discreet enough to wear around the airport. Having a secure spot for my **boarding passes and passport** meant they didn't go loose or get misplaced. I actually saw **three lost passports** that flight crew had found as we got off the plane at Heathrow, definitely not a situation you want to be in after 24 hours of flying.

### 9. Use Travel Cards and Apple Pay for Safer Transactions
Instead of using my regular transaction card, I used **travel cards from Wise, Up, or ING**. These offer free accounts and low overseas transaction fees. I kept minimal money on the card to reduce risk if I got overcharged. While I missed out on some credit card points, the added security was worth it.  
I also used **Apple Pay** with my iPhone whenever possible. It's fast, secure, and meant I wasn't fumbling through my wallet trying to find the right card. When paying, I always had my phone, card or cash ready so I didn't have to open my wallet or travel bag in public, keeping its contents hidden from view.

### 10. Print Out Essential Travel Documents
I printed out **copies of my travel documents** and left a set at home with someone I trust. If I lost my device, I could contact them in an emergency and still access important info.

## Final Thoughts: Travel Smart, Travel Happy

Travel is incredible, you get to meet new people, and create unforgettable memories. Whether you're wandering through ancient streets, navigating busy airports, or just soaking up the vibe of a new city, it's all part of the adventure.

And let's be honest, **travel is even more fun when you're not stressing about lost passports, hacked accounts, or sketchy Wi-Fi**. A little cybersecurity prep goes a long way in keeping your trip smooth, safe, and stress-free.

So pack your bags, charge your power bank, secure your sling bag (*European carryall*), and enjoy the journey. The world is waiting, and now you're ready to explore it securely.
