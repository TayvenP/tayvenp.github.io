# Social Media Privacy Reset

Social media connects us with friends, family, and communities - but it also creates opportunities for scammers, identity thieves, and data harvesters. A **privacy reset** is a quick way to take back control of your accounts, limit oversharing, and reduce your risk.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Oversharing fuels scams** - birthdates, addresses, and travel plans are gold for identity thieves.  
- **Loose privacy settings** can expose your posts to strangers, recruiters, or scammers.  
- **Old accounts and apps** often linger with access to your data.  

The good news: a privacy reset only takes a few minutes and makes a big difference.

## Step 1: Lock Your Profiles Down
- **Set profiles to private by default** - limit visibility to friends or trusted connections.  
- **Review audience per post** - avoid "Public" unless absolutely necessary.  
- **Disable location tagging** - don't broadcast where you are in real time.  

---

## Step 2: Review Past Posts
- **Limit older posts** to "Friends only."  
- **Delete sensitive content** (birthdates, addresses, school names, pet names).  
- **Check tagged photos** - require approval before tags appear on your profile.  

---

## Step 3: Control App and Account Sprawl
- **Review connected apps** - revoke access for games, quizzes, or apps you no longer use.  
- **Close unused accounts** - old profiles are easy targets.  
- **Turn on login alerts** - get notified if someone signs in from a new device.  

---

## Step 4: Share Less, Protect More
- **Avoid posting your full birthdate** - it's often used for identity verification.  
- **Don't announce travel in real time** - share photos after you return.  
- **Keep work details minimal** - anything you share about your work, job, unique software you use, job titles and employer names can enable targeted scams. Once you share this on LinkedIn be aware this is now public information. 

---

## Step 5: Stay Alert for Scams and Deepfakes
- **Be wary of urgent money requests** - even if it looks like a friend.  
- **Check the source** on videos and voice notes - AI can clone voices and faces.  
- **Report and block fakes** - don't engage with suspicious accounts.

## Five-Minute Privacy Reset Checklist

- Profiles set to private  
- Location tagging turned off  
- Past posts reviewed and cleaned  
- Connected apps trimmed  
- Login alerts enabled

## Quick FAQs

**Do I need to delete old posts?**  
Not always. At minimum, change the audience to "Friends" and remove anything that reveals private details.  

**Is it safe to accept friend requests from people I don't know?**  
No. Fake accounts are a common scam tactic. Only connect with people you trust.  

**What's the fastest win right now?**  
Set your profile to private and turn on login alerts. That alone blocks most casual snooping and alerts you to suspicious activity.

**Action for this week:** Spend five minutes reviewing your privacy settings on your main social media account. You'll be surprised how much you can lock down in one sitting.
