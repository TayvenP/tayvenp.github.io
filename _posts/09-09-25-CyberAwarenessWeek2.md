## Why This Matters
Most cyber incidents start with one thing: **weak or stolen credentials**.  
If someone gets into your account, they can steal your data, impersonate you, or even compromise your workplace systems. And with AI tools now part of daily life, there’s a new layer of risk - sharing the wrong information with the wrong tool can be just as damaging.

The good news? You can protect yourself with a few simple habits.

## Step 1: Build Strong Passphrases
Forget short, complex passwords you can’t remember. **Passphrases** are longer, easier to recall, and much harder to crack.

**How to create a strong passphrase:**
- **Build a passphrase from four or more random words** (minimum 16 characters total)  
  Example: `Kangaroo-sunset17-bicycle-ocean`
- Make each passphrase **unique** - never re‑use it
- Store them in a **reputable password manager**
- Where possible, enable **passkeys** - a phishing-resistant login method
- Check if your passwords have been exposed using **[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)**
- **Never share** your passphrases

---

## Step 2: Turn On Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)
Even the strongest passphrase can be stolen. MFA adds a second lock on the door.

## MFA Options

1. **Authenticator App**  
   Use a time-based one-time password (TOTP) app for strong, phishing-resistant codes.  
   - [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/security/mobile-authenticator-app)  
   - [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)  

2. **Hardware Security Key**  
   A physical device that provides the highest level of phishing resistance.  
   - [YubiKey (Yubico)](https://www.yubico.com/) 
3. **SMS codes** (better than nothing, but less secure)

Turn on MFA for:
- Email accounts
- Banking and financial services
- Social media
- Work systems

## Step 3: Enable Biometrics on Your Devices
Your phone, laptop, or tablet is a gateway to your accounts.  
Biometric authentication, like fingerprints or facial recognition, adds speed and security.

## How to Enable Biometrics on Your Device

- ** Apple (Face ID / Touch ID)** – [Set up Touch ID or Face ID on iPhone and iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-touch-id-iph672384a0b/ios)  
- ** Android (Fingerprint / Face Recognition)** – [Enable biometric authentication on Android](https://support.google.com/android/thread/130278667/how-can-i-enable-fingerprint-function?hl=en)  
- ** Windows (Windows Hello)** – [Configure Windows Hello for facial recognition, fingerprint, or PIN](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-windows-hello-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0)  


**Tips:**
- Use biometrics where available, they’re fast and secure
- Keep a strong passcode or passphrase as a backup
- Avoid simple swipe patterns, they’re easy to observe and guess from smudge marks

## Step 4: Use a Password Manager
A password manager securely stores all your passphrases in one encrypted vault, you only need to remember **one master passphrase**. It can also generate strong, unique passphrases for every account.

**Benefits:**
- No need to memorise dozens of logins
- Auto‑fills credentials on websites and apps
- Syncs across devices
- Alerts you if a password is weak or breached

## Step 5: In Public - Watch Out for Shoulder Surfing & Physical Device Security
Not all attacks are digital, sometimes people just watch you type.

**How to prevent it:**
- In public shield your screen and keyboard when entering credentials.  
- Be extra cautious in public spaces such as cafés, airports, or trains.  
- Don’t leave your devices on down on tables or unattended in public places.
- At work lock your device when stepping away, even for a moment. Use Windows + L.

## Step 6: Use AI Tools Safely
AI can be a powerful assistant, but it’s not always safe to share sensitive information.

**Safe AI habits:**
- **Never upload confidential or work data** to public AI tools
- Only use **approved AI platforms** for sensitive information
- Review privacy settings before using a new AI service
- Keep an eye out for **breach reports** or **privacy policy changes**
- Treat AI like a public forum, if you wouldn’t post it online, don’t put it in a chatbot

## Quick Takeaway
**Strong authentication is your first line of defence.**  
Combine long, unique passphrases with MFA, enable biometrics, use a password manager, stay alert in public, and treat AI tools with the same caution you’d use when speaking to a stranger.
