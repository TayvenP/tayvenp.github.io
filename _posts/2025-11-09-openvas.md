When it comes to the **ASD Essential Eight (E8)**, one of the biggest challenges isn't just implementing controls,it's proving maturity. Auditors and assessors want evidence, not just intent. The good news? You don't always need expensive tooling to get there.  

Previously, I used **OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)**,a free, open-source vulnerability scanner,to help uplift E8 maturity levels for an organisation. Here's how it worked, including the lessons learned when things didn't go perfectly.  

---

## The Problem
- We needed to demonstrate uplift in **Patch Applications** and **Patch Operating Systems** maturity levels.  
- Commercial vulnerability management platforms were out of budget.  
- Evidence had to be **audit-ready** and mapped directly to the E8 maturity model.  

---

## The OpenVAS Approach
OpenVAS provided exactly what we needed:
- **Automated scans** across servers and networking equipment to identify missing patches, outdated software, and misconfigurations.  
- **Evidence-based reporting** that could be exported and attached directly to audit packs.  
- **Regular updates** via the Greenbone feed, ensuring detection of the latest CVEs.  

By scheduling recurring scans, we established a **repeatable control** - a key requirement for progressing from **Maturity Level 0** to **Maturity Level 1 or 2**.

---

## Mapping to Essential Eight (Accurate View)
OpenVAS doesn't enforce patching or application allowlisting. Instead, it provides **visibility and evidence** that supports uplift when paired with patch management and application control processes.  

| Essential Eight Strategy | How OpenVAS Supports | What Else is Needed |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Patch Applications**   | Detects outdated/ vulnerable third-party apps and reports CVEs | Patch management workflows to remediate |
| **Patch Operating Systems** | Identifies missing OS patches and insecure versions | OS patching tools (WSUS, Intune, SCCM, etc.) |

## Audit-Ready Evidence
Instead of vague "we patch monthly" statements, we could now show:
- **Before/after scan reports** proving vulnerabilities were remediated.  
- **Trend data** showing reduced exposure over time.  
- **Documented workflows** linking OpenVAS scans to patch management tickets.  

This transformed our audit submissions from **narrative-based** to **evidence-based**,a huge credibility boost.  

---

## Lessons Learned the Hard Way
One of my earliest scans against a production server **brought it down entirely**. The aggressive **Full and Fast** configuration overloaded the application while it was under heavy demand. Even though the scan had been formally approved, the incident made it clear that OpenVAS should be scheduled outside business hours whenever possible.

That incident taught me:
- For high demand production systems **run scans after hours**.
- Schedule all scans after hours - between 10pm - 5am usually. The scans will automatically pause and restart during the next approved scheduled window.  
- Communicate clearly with system owners so they know what's coming.  

I also faced **pushback from certain teams**:
- Some worried about performance impacts.  
- Others argued "we don't have time to patch anyway."  

Winning them over meant showing the **audit-ready evidence**: before/after reports, trend lines, and proof that vulnerabilities were shrinking. Once they saw the value, the resistance softened.

## Scheduling Scans Without Disrupting Production
Running vulnerability scans in a live environment can be tricky. OpenVAS is powerful, but like any scanner, it consumes bandwidth and CPU cycles. If you run it at the wrong time, you risk slowing down business-critical systems.  

### How to Schedule Scans in OpenVAS
1. **Create a Scan Task** in the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) web UI.  
2. **Attach a Schedule** with start time, recurrence, and duration.  
3. **Tune Scan Intensity** by enabling safe checks, limiting concurrency, and segmenting large networks. 
4. **Select your targets** to be scanned regularly during approved scan windows.  

### Coordinating With Your Team
- **Agree on a Scan Window** (overnight, weekends, or maintenance windows).  
- **Communicate in Advance** so stakeholders know what to expect.  
- **Pilot First** on non-critical systems.  
- **Document the Schedule** in your change calendar or ITSM tool.  

**Remediation**: To organise remediation utilise your company's ITSM tool. Lodge tickets with the system owner through the tool. This gives you a transparent processes for both of you to monitor and update progress towards vulnerability remediation. For some systems this may require regular patch management so you may need to organise regular meetings with different system owners.

## Appendix: OpenVAS Installation Guide

### Recommended Operating System
- **Ubuntu Server (latest version supported)** > Best for production.  
- **Debian** > Lightweight, stable, good for dedicated appliances.  
- **Kali Linux** > Great for labs and testing, less suited for production.  

For workplace use, I recommend **Ubuntu Server LTS**. For personal labs, **Kali** is fine.  

### Installation Steps (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-start
gvm-check-setup
```
Access the web UI at `https://localhost:9392`.  

### Installation Steps (Kali Linux)
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-start
```
Access the web UI at `https://localhost:9392`.  

### Pro Tips
- Stop services when not in use:  
  ```bash
  sudo gvm-stop
  ```  
- Dedicate >4GB RAM and 2+ cores for production.  
- Export reports directly into audit evidence packs.
- Be sure not to overwhelm your OpenVAS server, schedule only a few scans to run simultaneously.

## Key Takeaways
- **Free doesn't mean ineffective**: OpenVAS gave us enterprise-grade visibility without the licensing cost.  
- **Evidence is everything**: Maturity uplift isn't just about doing the work,it's about proving it.  
- **Complementary tools are required**: OpenVAS detects, but patching and application control need dedicated solutions.  
- **Repeatability matters**: Scheduled scans and documented workflows are what move you up the maturity ladder.  
- **Mistakes teach maturity too**: Crashing a server once taught me more than any manual ever could.

## Final Thought
If your organisation is struggling to demonstrate E8 maturity uplift without budget for commercial tools, OpenVAS is a practical, no-cost way to generate **audit-ready evidence** and build momentum.  

Sometimes, the best uplift comes not from spending more,but from using what's already freely available, learning from the bumps along the way, and turning those lessons into stronger, more resilient practices.
