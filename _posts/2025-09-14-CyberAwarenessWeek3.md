## Why it matters
Scams are no longer just clumsy emails full of spelling mistakes. Today’s cybercriminals use **AI‑powered tools** to create convincing emails, text messages, phone calls, and even fake videos or voice recordings (“deepfakes”). These can be so realistic that they trick even the most cautious among us.

In 2024–25, Australians reported a **cybercrime every six minutes**, with millions of dollars lost to scams. The more realistic the scam, the more important it is to **pause, verify, and protect yourself**.

## Protect yourself: Step‑by‑step review using the indicators
For situations involving unverified contacts, callers, or other unsolicited approaches.

1. **Pause before you act**  
   - **Email/SMS/Chat:** Do not click links, open attachments, reply, or forward.  
   - **Calls/Video:** Do not share information, approve payments, or install software during the interaction.

2. **Scan for urgency or pressure**  
   - **Red flags:** “Pay now,” “account will be closed,” “confirm within 2 hours,” “keep this confidential.”  
   - **Action:** Slow down. Scammers manufacture urgency to bypass your judgement.

3. **Check the source details**  
   - **Email:**  
     - **Sender domain:** Hover the “From” address; look for misspellings or look‑alike domains (e.g., `paypa1.com`).  
     - **Links:** Hover to reveal the true destination; it should exactly match the official domain.  
   - **SMS:**  
     - **Number:** Random or international numbers, or messages that move a conversation from a verified thread to a new number.  
     - **Links:** Shortened or odd‑looking links.  
   - **Call/Voicemail:**  
     - **Caller ID:** Blocked, private, or spoofed to resemble a known organisation.  
     - **Callback numbers:** Don’t trust numbers given in the message; independently look up the official number.  
   - **Video/Social:**  
     - **Account:** Is it verified/official? New account? Low history?  
     - **Context:** Unexpected contact or off‑brand style.

4. **Check the content carefully**  
   - **Language and tone:** Generic greetings (“Dear Customer”), unusual phrasing, spelling errors, or a tone that doesn’t match previous messages.  
   - **Requests:** Passwords, PINs, MFA codes, remote access, gift cards, crypto, invoice changes, or bank detail changes.  
   - **Attachments/links:** Unexpected PDFs/ZIPs/Docs; URLs that don’t match the visible text.  
   - **Deepfake clues (for video/voice):** Lip‑sync lag, odd blinking, inconsistent lighting/shadows, audio glitches or robotic tone, sudden uncharacteristic behaviour.

5. **Verify independently (second channel)**  
   - **Contact the organisation or person using a number/address you find yourself** (official website, saved contact, past invoice). Not the details in the message.  
   - **Cross‑check:** Search exact phrases online; many scam templates are widely reported.  
   - **Workplace:** Follow your internal verification and reporting process.

6. **Decide and act**  
   - **Safe:** No red flags and verification checks out > proceed as normal.  
   - **Suspicious:** One or two red flags > do not interact! Verify further or ask IT/Security, contact company through offical means.
   - **Malicious:** Multiple red flags or failed verification > report using the tools below, then delete/block.

7. **Report and remove**  
   - **Use built‑in reporting:** Outlook/Gmail phishing report; forward SMS to 7226 (Telstra).  
   - **Report officially:** Lodge a report at ReportCyber.  
   - **Then:** Delete the message, block the sender, and, if at work, notify your security team.

> Pro tips  
> - **Type, don’t tap:** For banking/government/work, manually type the website or search with Google/Bing instead of using links in the message.  
> - **MFA code rule:** Never share MFA codes or approve prompts you did not initiate.  
> - **Screenshots:** Report messages with your phish report button to your security team, or capture evidence before deleting to aid reporting and training with screenshots.

## Top indicators of phishing attempts

| Indicator | What it looks like | Why it’s suspicious | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Urgency or threats** | “Your account will be closed in 24 hours” / “Pay now to avoid legal action” | Designed to make you panic and act without thinking | Pause; verify via official contact channels |
| **Unfamiliar or altered sender address** | `support@paypa1.com` vs `support@paypal.com` | Look‑alike domains trick you into trusting the sender | Hover to reveal the true domain; compare with official site |
| **Generic greetings** | “Dear Customer” | Legit organisations usually use your name | Treat as a red flag and verify |
| **Unexpected attachments or links** | Random PDFs/ZIPs/Docs or “View invoice” links | Malware or credential‑harvesting pages | Don’t open; confirm with the sender first |
| **Spelling/formatting errors** | Awkward phrasing, mixed fonts | Common in mass scams or poor translations | Combine with other signs; do not rely on this alone |
| **Mismatched URLs** | Text shows `www.bank.com` but hover shows `bank-login-secure.com` | Visible link differs from the destination | Type the address manually instead |
| **Requests for sensitive info** | Passwords, PINs, MFA codes, ID scans | Legit orgs won’t ask via email/SMS | Report to ReportCyber and delete |
